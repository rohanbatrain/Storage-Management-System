### Locations
Everything in SMS lives in a **Location**. Locations are hierarchical.

- **Root Locations**: Start by creating high-level locations like "Home" or "Office".

### Items
Items are the things you track.
- **Generic Items**: Electronics, tools, documents, etc.
- **Clothing Items**: Have extra metadata like brand, size, color, material.
